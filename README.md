> **Note:** All npm commands work identically on Windows, macOS, and Linux. This project is fully cross-platform compatible.

### Step 6: Start Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

## Project Structure

This boilerplate follows clean architecture principles:

- **`src/dal/`** - Data Access Layer (pure functions for HTTP requests)
- **`src/features/*/api/`** - React Query hooks for data fetching
- **`src/features/*/components/`** - Presentational components
- **`src/features/*/containers/`** - Container components for data orchestration
- **`src/components/`** - Shared reusable UI components
- **`src/lib/http/`** - Centralized HTTP client configuration

## Tech Stack

- **React 19** - Latest stable version of React
- **TypeScript 5** - Type-safe JavaScript
- **Vite** - Fast build tool and dev server
- **TailwindCSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **React Query** - Server state management
- **ESLint** - Code linting with TypeScript support

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build

## Building Cool Stuff

Now that you're set up with Cursor and this boilerplate, you're ready to start building! The project structure is set up to help you organize your code cleanly and efficiently. Use Cursor's AI features to help you write components, create API integrations, and build amazing React applications.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
